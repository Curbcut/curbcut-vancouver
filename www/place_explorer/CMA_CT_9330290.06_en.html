        // In some complex fill-based layouts with multiple outputs (e.g., plotly),
        // shiny initializes with the correct sizing, but in-between the 1st and last
        // renderValue(), the size of the output containers can change, meaning every
        // output but the 1st gets initialized with the wrong size during their
        // renderValue(); and then after the render phase, shiny won't know trigger a
        // resize since all the widgets will return to their original size
        // (and thus, Shiny thinks there isn't any resizing to do).
        // We workaround that situation by manually triggering a resize on the binding
        // when the output container changes (this way, if the size is different during
        // the render phase, Shiny will know about it)
